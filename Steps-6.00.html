According to the University of California, San Diego County alone lost over&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">8,000</span>&nbsp;acres of avocado groves between 2007 and 2012.&nbsp; Moreover, The State Water Efficiency and Enhancement Program<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://calclimateag.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f573714ed93e8a8fc2ef5d827&amp;id=b401b33620&amp;e=75fe25389a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style="color: var(--color-blue); text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0); text-decoration-color: unset !important;">SWEEP</span></a><span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">) was cut</span>, which incentivized farmers for on-site water conservation. To address the water shortage issue in California, I suggest that policymakers and water management authorities can implement measures aimed at increasing water efficiency and reducing water waste such as increased investment in water infrastructure including reservoirs and pipelines, to help store and transport water more efficiently.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Climate change: The changing climate has led to unpredictable weather patterns, including temperature fluctuations and extreme weather events, which can impact avocado growth and development. The historic drought that lasted from 2012 to 2016 caused an estimated&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">$3.8 billion</span>&nbsp;in economic losses to California's agriculture industry alone, according to a study by the University of California. The same study estimated that the total economic cost of the drought to California was&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">$2.7 billion per year</span>. Therefore, I suggest that they should consider giving incentives for greenhouses that can shield avocado trees from extreme weather conditions like frost, high winds, and heavy rain, which can damage or kill the trees.<br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pests and diseases: Avocado production can be affected by pests such as thrips, mites, and beetles, as well as diseases such as root rot, anthracnose, and avocado sunblotch viroid. For example, a 2015 study by the University of California Cooperative Extension estimated that avocado growers in California lose an average of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">$50 million</span>&nbsp;annually due to pests and diseases. This study also found that the most significant losses were due to avocado thrips, which caused an estimated&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">$29 million</span>&nbsp;in losses per year. My suggestion to farmers would be regularly monitored trees for signs of pest and disease damage and use integrated pest management techniques to minimize their impact. This can include using natural predators, biocontrol, and pesticides only when necessary and in a targeted way. Moreover, the government should hold seminars that give them the necessary guidance and information about techniques and tools that can help them with more production.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Market competition: According to data from the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, the US imported approximately&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">708 million pounds&nbsp;</span>(321,000 metric tons) of avocados from Mexico in 2010. This represents a significant increase from previous years. According to my dashboard sales went up to 56% higher and prices went down meaning people are giving preference to imported and foreign products. Therefore, my suggestions are California growers can try to be marketing and branding strategies such as promoting their unique flavor, texture, and nutritional value as well as supporting local products.</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;<img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1208/6/1.jpg" style="width: 778.239px; height: 438.049px;"></div></div>
